                            In their final year of high school in 2014, the five
                            boys, Swain, Hetherington, Hill, Serret and
                            Crommelin, formed as Parcels. The story behind the
                            name 'Parcels' differs from source to source.
                            Consistently, the members report having taken the
                            name from an old train sign that resided at Swain's
                            parent's house. In one interview the sign is said to
                            be seen in Swain's parent's pastry caf√®. Another
                            says that Swain stole the sign from their local
                            train station and hung it in his basement.
